# MST
This repository contains the implementation of the MST model as described in our paper titled “MST: A Multi-Scale Transformer Framework with Cross-Scale Token Fusion for Automatic Modulation Recognition”. Additionally, it contains the checkpoints corresponding to the best results achieved by this model.
## Version Information 
- Pytorch 2.4.0 
- Cuda 12.1.1 
- Python 3.11 
- yacs 0.1.8 
- torchsummaryX 1.3.0 
- einops 0.8.0
## File Architecture 
The file architecture is referenced from the paper titled “[Convolutional Neural Network Assisted Transformer for Automatic Modulation Recognition under Large CFOs and SROs](https://github.com/DTMB-DL/TransGroupNet)”. If you want to get started quickly, you can integrate our relevant code into their open-source file architecture to run it.  
We sincerely appreciate the open-source contributions made by the researchers involved in this work.
